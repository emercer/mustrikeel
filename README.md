Towards a Pattern Language for Describing Ubiquitous Interactions

Building upon previous,  extensive literature review on distributed user interfaces, this paper traces the attempt to collect all instances of interaction techniques targeted towards Multi-Display Environments into design patterns, general reusable solutions to problems unique to the area of MDEs. Once these problems are properly identified and their solutions collected into a pattern catalogue, the study expands into applying taxonomic and social network analysis to identify how these solutions relate between themselves and build the scaffolding for a pattern language on distributed user interfaces.
